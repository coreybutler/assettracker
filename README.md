<h1>About AssetTracker</h1>

AssetTracker is a web-based tool for documenting assets in your IT infrastructure. It helps keep track of changing information about desktops, servers, and network devices. All of this leads to a better understanding of your infrastructure footprint and how to optimize it.

Running a small IT Infrastructure ranging from 5-100 devices poses unique challenges. These environments are often less regulated than larger infrastructures, and many tasks are still performed manually. Even if a small environment uses network management software, it can still be lacking decent documentation.

For example, we use network monitoring software that recognizes PostgreSQL installations on our DB servers, but the software can't recognize specific databases. Using AssetTracker, we list which databases exist on which servers &amp; display the reports in real-time on our Wiki. Our web &amp; ETL developers can then see which servers are more available than others without having to ask anyone.

Requirements:
* Adobe ColdFusion 8+
* PostgreSQL 8.1+ or MySQL 5+
* ExtJS 3.1 Full (auto-installed using installer)
* Active Directory

AssetTracker has only been tested in the environments listed above. It may work in additional environments such as Railo/Blue Dragon. Alternative databases such as SQL Server and Oracle are also likely to work with very minor modifications (if any). If you test the application in a variation of the environment above, please notify us so we can update this page.
